# Tuning Tomcat Ports

- To have the tomcat to be hosted in secured way we need to run it using the SSL certs.
- By default we will have a section for this. 
- All we need to do is that we need to uncomment the ***Connector*** section with the SSL details.
- In the same way we can change the port numbers to any other open port numbers.
- We might need to change the port numbers to secure our tomcat application.
